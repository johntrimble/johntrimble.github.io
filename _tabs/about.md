Hi, I’m **John Trimble** — a machine learning engineer and tech lead.

With nearly two decades of experience, I've spent my career designing, developing, and scaling software systems. My journey here has included many phases: from shipping resilient backend systems, to architecting Kubernetes operators, to forecasting CPU usage from live production metrics. Along the way, I’ve built internal tools, contributed to open source (e.g. [cass-operator](https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator)), and engaged stakeholders across the board—product, customers, support, and multiple engineering disciplines—to align on goals and deliver results.

I currently lead autoscaling for [Astra DB Serverless](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/index.html), where we create self-driving systems—powered by data, models, and automation—that monitor themselves, adapt to changing workloads, and scale to meet user needs.
