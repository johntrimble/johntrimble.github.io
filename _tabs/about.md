Hi, I’m **John Trimble** — a software engineer, tech lead, and long-time student of machine learning.

With nearly two decades of experience building software systems, I’ve spent my career designing, developing, and scaling resilient infrastructure. I currently lead development of the **CNDB Autoscaler** at [DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/), a critical component of the **Astra DB serverless platform**. My work sits at the intersection of distributed systems, observability, and automated decision-making — and I love that.

My path here has spanned many phases: from shipping resilient backend systems, to architecting Kubernetes operators, to forecasting CPU usage from live production metrics. Along the way, I’ve built internal tools like *Dornick*, contributed to open source (e.g. [cass-operator](https://github.com/datastax/cass-operator)), and worked closely with both core database teams and frontline support.

I'm currently focused on building tools that combine **data, models, and automation** — systems that watch themselves, adapt to new workloads, and scale with user needs.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is my home on the internet. It's a place where I:

- Share technical deep-dives on systems I've built or admired.
- Write about practical ML applications for real-world systems.
- Reflect on engineering leadership, reliability, and long-term thinking.
- Experiment with tools, automation, and ideas that don’t quite fit elsewhere.
